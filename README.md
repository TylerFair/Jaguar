### JAGUAR (JWST-Jax Accelerated GPU Uniform Analysis & Reduction)

A Jax-based JWST exoplanet data reduction framework prioritized to utilize GPU-support. 
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
### Currently available sections:

#### - Stage 4: 
light curve fitting

(bad-column pixel correction with Gaussian Processing | generation and fitting of whitelight light curve | outlier rejection of whitelight light curve | generation and fitting of low and high-resolution spectroscopic light curves | outlier rejection of low-res spectroscopic light curves | optional interpolation of limb-darkening and trend parameters from low to high-res | creation of transmission spectrum)

### Currently nearing end of development:

#### - Stage 3: 
spectral extraction

(background subtraction | optimal extraction)
